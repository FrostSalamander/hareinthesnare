Because I'm using modules for walls, I have to monsterclip the hell out of each room, which means I can't place switches in normal places like next to doors (cause AI always get caught in doorways without MC).  Now because all the lights have switches, you can just easily switch all the lights off and the AI can't turn them back on.  I even tried the relight_position entity and it didn't help
